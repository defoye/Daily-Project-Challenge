#### What does it do
1. Asks user for location permissions. 
2. Starts updating location. 
3. Zooms in on Map View that displays user's current location. 

#### Notes
* It looks like the simulator does not have access to a GPS. I have tested the app with a scheme that simulates a location, but not with a real GPS.

#### Features to add
* Search bar for a location
* Beacons
